Using a PNP 2222 i've added a cpu fan to my Raspberry Pi servers.

The cpufan.py python script reads the cpu temp every 10 seconds (configurable) and if has exceeded the MAX temp
(also configurable) turns the fan on.

The fan used is a 5 volt cpu fan purchased from Amazon which can run directly off of the 5 volt GPIO pins of the
Raspberry Pi.

By using a PNP 2222 transistor I'm able to turn the fan on and off using Pin 18 (configurable) with the python script.
I'm using /etc/rc.local to execute the script at system boot.
